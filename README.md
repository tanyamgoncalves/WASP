WASP: Web Audio Sound Programming

About: New developments in the Web Audio API have allowed programmers and musicians to explore new foundations of networking, computer programming, and music creation. Recent projects built over the Web Audio API have emphasized creating accessible musical programming environments and languages. WASP is a web audio programming language that teaches novice users about classical musical notation, while also encouraging them to explore practices of musical live coding. The language was designed because of a personal interest in computer science, live coding, and musical performance. WASP was born from the personal belief that it is important for students to be exposed to textbook fundamental languages (i.e. C, C++, Java, Python), but it is also equally important to expose students to creative programming languages (i.e. SuperCollider, Processing, JavaScript, CSS). It is my personal belief as a researcher that we will see an increased interest and integration of students in computer science if they are exposed to both kinds of programming languages. By creating accessible, user-friendly, educational audio programming languages, we can provide a unique outlook for students to understand and find new interest in computer programming.
